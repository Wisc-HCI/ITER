# Interdependence Task Experiment Runner - Analysis

## Overview
Stores analysis code for the ITER data generated during the experiment. All data
should be stored in the data subdirectory with the appropriate gitignore to prevent upload.
The code itself is written as a set of notebooks to extract the data collected, run the
appropriate analysis, and generate plots/tables for paper.

## Requirements
Install jupyter notebook and R studio. I recommend setting everything up with anaconda.

Also run the experiment, making sure to collect the interaction logs from the RAD system.

## Credit
