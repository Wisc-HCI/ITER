External power on robotiq (proves out SCB Fuse)
Swap out robotiq gripper into another robot (proves out gripper)
Swap in robotiq gripper from another robot (proves rest of chain - do only if gripper works in other robot)
Use second cable (proves out first cable + adapter + SCB if we assume it is good)

Get a technician to debug?
