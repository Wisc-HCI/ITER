# (Correctly) averaging quaternions
Python function for correct averaging of multiple quaternions. Quaternions representations provide no trivial means of averaging multiple quaternions. Even though avaraging of the components can be used in some cases, this approach has major drawbacks (as explained in the paper cited below).

The function given here implements are more "mathematically correct" way of averaging. The paper also provides a way to do a weighted average (individual "importance of each quaternion"), which is implemented as well.

## Note on efficiency

This method is computationally expensive compared to naive mean averaging.
If only low accuracy is required (or the quaternions have similar orientations),
then quaternion averaging can possibly be done through simply averaging the
components (will require normalization).

### Side note
In computer graphics, averaging or blending of two quaternions is often done through
spherical linear interploation (slerp). Even though it's often used it might not be the best
way to do things, as described in this post:
