# Experiment Therblig Task Runner

##  Overview
Task runner ROS will run set of therbligs on UR3/UR5 robotic arms. Developed to run experiments in task dependence and RAD signaling. The following nodes were developed.

* Therblig_Runner
  * ROS node to manage robot behavior from therbligs and button input; computes RAD signal.
* Experiment_CLI
  * Command line interface to trigger experimental conditions.
  * [Documentation](/Experiments.md)
* RAD_UI
  * Presents RAD signal to user. Ignore if not being used for study.
  * [Documentation](/rad_ui/README.md)
* Button
  * Interfaces with smart button for participant input while interacting with robot.
